I am a graduate student in the [Epidemiology Department](https://epi.washington.edu/) at [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/). Before I join UW, I worked as an applications programmer with Professor [Trey Ideker](http://idekerlab.ucsd.edu/trey-ideker/) at UC San Diego School of Medicine. I received my Bachelor’s degree in Bioinformatics from [UC San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/) in 2018. During my undergraduate studies, I was a research assistant in [Ideker Lab](http://idekerlab.ucsd.edu/) and a lab technician in [Computational Neurobiology Lab](https://cnl.salk.edu/) at [Salk Institute](https://www.salk.edu/).

My research interests lie in the intersection of data science and healthcare. I am interested in developing machine learning methods to answer questions on genomics, population health and clinical decision making.
