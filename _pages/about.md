I am a graduate student advised by [Alison Feder](https://federlab.github.io) in the Department of [Genome Sciences](https://www.gs.washington.edu) at [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/). I completed my MPH in Epidemiology with [Sara Lindström](https://research.fredhutch.org/lindstroem/en.html) at [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/). Before I join UW, I worked as an applications programmer with [Trey Ideker](http://idekerlab.ucsd.edu/trey-ideker/) at UC San Diego School of Medicine. I received my Bachelor’s degree in Bioinformatics from [UC San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/) in 2018. During my undergraduate studies, I was a research assistant in [Ideker Lab](http://idekerlab.ucsd.edu/) and a lab technician in [Computational Neurobiology Lab](https://cnl.salk.edu/) at [Salk Institute](https://www.salk.edu/).

I currently study the spatial evolutionary dynamics of _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_ in the cystic fibrosis lung through [CFTR modulator therapy](https://www.cff.org/managing-cf/cftr-modulator-therapies). More broadly, I am interested in the intersection of computational methods and genomics, with a focus on understanding the dynamics of evolving biological systems and their implications for population health.
