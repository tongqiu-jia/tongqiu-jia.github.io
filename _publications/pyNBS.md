## Abstract
 We present pyNBS: a modularized Python 2.7 implementation of the network-based stratification (NBS) algorithm for stratifying tumor somatic mutation profiles into molecularly and clinically relevant subtypes. In addition to release of the software, we benchmark its key parameters and provide a compact cancer reference network that increases the significance of tumor stratification using the NBS algorithm. The structure of the code exposes key steps of the algorithm to foster further collaborative development.
